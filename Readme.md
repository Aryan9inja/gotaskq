# GoTaskQ - Distributed Job Queue System in Go

## 1. Project Overview
GoTaskQ is a distibuted job queue system built in Go. Clients submit jobs via HTTP, and a pool of goroutines (workers) process them asynchronously with gaurantee around reliablity, ordering and failure handling.

### Tech Stack
- **Go**: Core language for server and worker implementation.
- **Chi**: Lightweight HTTP router for API endpoints.
- **Redis**: Primary storage for queues, job states, and Pub/Sub notifications.
- **In-Memory Priority Heap**: For fast job scheduling in development mode.
- **Snowflake IDs**: For unique, time-ordered job identifiers.
- **Prometheus**: For metrics and observability.
- **Go Routines & Channels**: For concurrent worker processing and coordination.

## 3. Key Design Decisions
| Decision | What I chose | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queue storage | Redis Sorted Set | Score = priority + timestamp, O(log n) dequeue |
| Job IDs | Snowflake | Time-ordered, no DB roundtrip, distributed-safe |
| Worker notification | Redis Pub/Sub | Avoids polling, low latency dispatch |
| Concurrency primitive | Mutex for queue, channels for dispatch | Mutex = shared state protection, channels = coordination |
| Persistence | Pluggable (memory/Redis) | Lets you demo both, shows abstraction thinking |
| Retry strategy | Exponential backoff | Avoids thundering herd on downstream failures |
